    <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) work together harmoniously to create visually appealing and structured web pages. 
       HTML serves as the backbone, providing the content and structure of the webpage through various elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more.</p>

    <p>CSS, on the other hand, enhances the presentation and styling of these HTML elements. 
       It allows developers to define how the content should be displayed on the webpage, including layout, fonts, colors, and other visual aspects. 
       By separating the content (HTML) from its presentation (CSS), developers can maintain cleaner and more maintainable code, 
       making it easier to update and modify the appearance of the webpage without altering its structure.
