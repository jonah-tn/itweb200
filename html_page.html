<p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard language used to create and structure content on web pages. 
   It forms the foundation of every webpage, providing a set of elements and attributes that define the structure and semantic meaning of the content. 
   HTML documents are composed of a series of elements, each represented by tags enclosed in angle brackets. 
   These tags instruct the web browser on how to display the content and convey its purpose to both browsers and search engines.</p>

<p>The concept of tags is central to HTML's structure. 
   Tags are keywords or identifiers enclosed within angle brackets (< and >) that indicate the beginning and end of an element. 
   They come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag, with content placed between them. 
   Opening tags denote the start of an element and contain attributes that provide additional information about the element, such as its ID, class, or style. 
   Closing tags signify the end of an element and are identical to the opening tag except for the addition of a forward slash (/) before the tag name. 
   Together, these tags form a hierarchical structure, with nested elements encapsulating their content and defining the relationships between different parts of the webpage. 
   By using tags appropriately, developers can create well-organized and semantically meaningful documents that are accessible, searchable, and easily interpreted by both humans and machines.

<p>An example of a tag would be "< h2 >Look at me< /h2 >"</p>
