    <p> <span class="CSS">Cascading Style Sheets</span> (CSS) is a fundamental component of modern web development, serving as the language used to define the visual presentation and layout of HTML elements on a webpage. 
        With CSS, developers can control various stylistic aspects of a webpage, including fonts, colors, spacing, and positioning, enabling them to create visually appealing and engaging user interfaces. 
        By separating the content and structure (HTML) from its presentation (CSS), developers can maintain cleaner and more maintainable code, facilitating easier updates and modifications to the appearance of the website.

    <p> 
        One of the key features of CSS is its cascading nature, which allows developers to apply styles hierarchically, with styles defined at different levels     of  specificity. 
        This cascade of styles ensures that elements inherit styles from their parent elements and can be overridden by more specific style declarations. 
        Additionally, CSS offers a wide range of selectors and properties, providing developers with powerful tools to target specific elements and customize their appearance. 
        With the evolution of CSS over the years, including the introduction of CSS preprocessors and frameworks, developers have gained even greater flexibility and efficiency in styling web pages, further enhancing the capabilities and aesthetics of modern websites.

    <p>I used CSS to change the "Cascading Style Sheets" in the first sentence to a bright red color along with setting the height and width on the html_page to 200px.
